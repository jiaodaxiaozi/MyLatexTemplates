@article{Borndorfer2007,
abstract = {The line-planning problem is one of the fundamental problems in strategic planning of public and rail transport. It involves finding lines and corresponding frequencies in a transport network such that a given travel demand can be satisfied. There are (at least) two objectives: the transport company wishes to minimize operating costs, and the passengers want to minimize traveling times.We propose a new multicommodity flow model for line planning. Its main features, in comparison to existing models, are that the passenger paths can be freely routed and lines are generated dynamically. We discuss properties of this model, investigate its complexity, and present a column-generation algorithm for its solution. Computational results with data for the city of Potsdam, Germany, are reported.},

@article{Goossens2006,
abstract = {An important strategic element in the planning process of a railway operator is the development of a line plan, i.e., a set of routes (paths) on the network of tracks, operated at a given hourly frequency. The models described in the literature have thus far considered only lines that halt at all stations along their route. In this paper we introduce several models for solving line planning problems in which lines can have different halting patterns. Correctness and equivalence proofs for these models are given, as well as an evaluation using several real-life instances. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
